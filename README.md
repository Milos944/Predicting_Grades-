# Predicting_Grades-
Predicting student grades via Linear Regression Algorithm(Machine Learning)

First we want do incooporate data from students that can be found online.
# Import only attributes of our data (essentialy we want to train 90% of our data)
# Set up two arrays, one is going to define attributes and the other one will define labels
# Split into four variables
# Next step is to implement an algorithm and use it to predict and train our data set
# Next is to use this data to predict grades on a real student in a real time
# Next step is to visualise our data via style.use
# Next step is to set labels for our axies and print graph
